Application 2 - Node.js / Express.js API

This is one of my first simple Node.js APIs built with the use of the Express library.

The API connects to an SQL database and handles different routes to execute different queries in the database.

This API is used as part of a Web application in which Students, enrolled in different Classes, will sumbit evaluations
about the Classes they are enrolled in.

The API is up and running, you can test it and get data from the database here:
https://web-production-42d1e.up.railway.app/

Please note that this specific version of the API is connected to a test database so no matter if you interact with the database,
it will have no harmful impact to the actual database.
